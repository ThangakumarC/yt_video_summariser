# YouTube Transcript to Detailed Notes Converter

This project allows users to convert YouTube video transcripts into detailed, summarized notes. Using Streamlit as the frontend, the app enables users to input a YouTube video link, fetch its transcript, and generate a summary with various lengths (small, medium, large). The generated summaries are stored in a local SQLite database, and users can view, delete, and manage their past summaries.
